Before making production ready we can add/improve following points
- We can add few more debug and info logs by using external log files.
- Exception handling can be done in better way by using @exceptionHandler class.
- Langauge specific exception messages can be added.
- Instead of in memory storage DB integration can be done, in order to use capabilities of springboot transaction management using @Transactional.
- More scenarios can be tested by creating multiple threads in test cases.
